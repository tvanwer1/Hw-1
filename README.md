# Context
This is an updated version of the avocado dataset originally compiled from the Hass Avocado Board (or HAB, for short) data and published on Kaggle by Justin Kiggins in 2018. The dataset features historical data on avocado prices and sales volume by conventional vs organic types. 

# Content
This updated version contains data form January 2015 up to July 2020. The updated dataset was created by downloading the data for the years 2020. To download some new data, scroll down to the bottom of the section "Totals by PLU" and click the "Download 2020 Weekly Retail Volume & Price Report" button. 

Here's how the Hass Avocado Board describes the data on their website:

    The table below represents weekly retail scan data for National retail volume (units) and price. Retail scan data comes directly from retailers’ cash registers based on actual retail sales of Hass avocados. Starting in 2015, the table below reflects an expanded, multi-outlet retail data set. Multi-outlet reporting includes an aggregation of the following channels: grocery, mass, club, drug, dollar and military. The Average Price (of avocados) in the table reflects a per unit (per avocado) cost, even when multiple units (avocados) are sold in bags. The Product Lookup codes (PLU’s) in the table are only for Hass avocados. Other varieties of avocados (e.g. greenskins) are not included in this table.

Some relevant columns in the dataset:

    Date - The date of the observation
    AveragePrice - the average price of a single avocado
    type - conventional or organic
    year - the year
    Region - the city or region of the observation
    Total Volume - Total number of avocados sold
    4046 - Total number of avocados with PLU 4046 sold
    4225 - Total number of avocados with PLU 4225 sold
    4770 - Total number of avocados with PLU 4770 sold
